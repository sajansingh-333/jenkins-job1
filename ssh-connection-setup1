$ sudo useradd userA
$ sudo su userA
$ cd ..
$ cd ~/userA
$ mkdir -p ~/userA/.ssh
$ cd ~/userA/.ssh
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@domain.com"
$ ls ~/.ssh/id_* 
output :
/home/userA/.ssh/id_rsa /home/userA/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

###copying the key to remote server

$ ssh-copy-id remote_username@server_ip_address
#####You will be prompted to enter the remote user password:

Output :
remote_username@server_ip_address's password:

####Once the user is authenticated, the public key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub will be appended to the remote user ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file, and the connection will be closed.

output :
Number of key(s) added: 1

###Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'username@server_ip_address'"
####and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

####If by some reason the ssh-copy-id utility is not available on your local computer, use the following command to copy the public key:

$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh remote_username@server_ip_address "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

##To test it, try to login to your server via SSH:
ssh remote_username@server_ip_address
If you havenâ€™t set a passphrase for the private key, you will be logged in immediately. Otherwise, you will be prompted to enter the passphrase.

#############Disabling SSH Password Authentication####################
###Disabling the password authentication adds an extra layer of security to your server.

Before disabling SSH password authentication, make sure you can log in to your server without a password, and the user you are logging in with has sudo privileges .

Log into your remote server:

ssh sudo_user@server_ip_address
##############Open the SSH configuration file with your text editor :

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
###############Search for the following directives and modify as it follows:

vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PasswordAuthentication no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
UsePAM no
Copy
#########Once done, save the file and restart the SSH service by typing:

sudo systemctl restart ssh
################At this point, the password-based authentication is disabled.
