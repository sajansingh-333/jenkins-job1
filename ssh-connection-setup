###copying the key to remote server

$ ssh-copy-id remote_username@server_ip_address
#####You will be prompted to enter the remote user password:

Output :
remote_username@server_ip_address's password:

####Once the user is authenticated, the public key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub will be appended to the remote user ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file, and the connection will be closed.

output :
Number of key(s) added: 1

###Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'username@server_ip_address'"
####and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

####If by some reason the ssh-copy-id utility is not available on your local computer, use the following command to copy the public key:

$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh remote_username@server_ip_address "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

##To test it, try to login to your server via SSH:
ssh remote_username@server_ip_address
If you havenâ€™t set a passphrase for the private key, you will be logged in immediately. Otherwise, you will be prompted to enter the passphrase.
